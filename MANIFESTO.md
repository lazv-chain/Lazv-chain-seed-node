# LAZV Chain Manifesto

## Philosophy
- **Polygon = Mother Chain**
  - Provides liquidity & legitimacy
  - Origin of value (LUZV ERC-20)

- **LAZV Chain = Sovereign Chain**
  - Community-run execution layer
  - Native coin = WLUZV / LAZV (1:1 backed)
  - Minting only via Polygon bridge proof

- **Trust-Minimized**
  - No inflation
  - No admin mint
  - Nodes & relayers are community-managed
  - Multisig for bridge owner

## Vision
- Allow builders worldwide to run nodes
- Make LAZV Chain a true open-chain
- Anchor digital gold (LUZV) with eMass / Gold coin (LAZV)
- Provide tools for explorer, light wallet, governance snapshots

## Builder Guidelines
1. Deploy node.py → sync chain
2. Run relayer → submit proof from Polygon bridge
3. Run explorer → track blocks, minted, burned, peers
4. Use seeds.json + peers.json → connect all nodes
5. Participate in community governance snapshots
